# 📘 ISLR — Exercises & Notes

This repository contains my notes and solutions to exercises from  
**“An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)”** by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

The goal of this repo is to document my progress, deepen my understanding of **statistical learning**, and practice implementing methods in **Python**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in **machine learning and statistics**
- Solve exercises from ISLR and explain the intuition behind them
- Apply models in **Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- Track learning progress chapter by chapter
